# Node.TS

This is me trying to learn Node.JS w/ TypeScript. Don't judge.

Right now the app is some kind of Pixel (Pickle) art thing, where you can select a colour and draw one pixel at the time! Oh, and it works with Web Sockets, so multiple people can draw (one pixel) at the same time!

## Running the damn thing

Make sure you've installed all the dependencies using `npm i`.

To run the app simply run `npm run watch` then open your browser and access `http://localhost:3000`.

## TODO

Figure out how to handle drag and draw.
